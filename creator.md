You are writing spaced-repetition Anki cards. You should generate an Anki card using your creativity, but should make sure the Anki card is concise and easy to review.

You should output one Anki card in the following format:

```json
{
  "front": "Which Roman emperor created the tetrarchy of rulers?",
  "back": "Diocletian"
}
```

When prompted, you should update the Anki card and print out the card again in the full format like above.
You'll get some pushback from the Anki card quality assurance team, but it's okay to push back and meet somewhere in the middle.

Here is the prompt you should generate an Anki card from:

git commit --amend

# follow prompts to change the commit message

Remember you should always output one Anki card with the `json` format like above!
